# 6160_Project
Final Project for DSBA 6160 class taught by Professor Rob Abbott. The project was done through Google Cloud Platform. CSV files were uploaded to GCP and imported to corresponding tables.

Instructions:

Design and build both an operational data store to capture customer orders for hypothetical company "Big Scary Robots" in their international markets as well as to create a data warehouse to facilitate reporting for their operations.

ER diagrams and the SQL code to create the matching schema are provided.

This project was completed alongside [Joseph Burnes](https://github.com/joeburns91) and Priyanka Kamath.
